# Test task for Lightspeed

Check task in TASK.md

## Instruments that wasn't in the task

- nuxt - to make code better organized (also I needed some practice with it)
- pinia - as the most recent state manager
- vuetify - I used that UI-kit on some of my previous projects and like it. Also it's very common
- linter/prettier - I used standard settings to make my code more general

## Archeture

I prefer to work with modular domain systems, but in this project I decided to use default nuxt structure

## Tests

- store with full coverage
- cart page - other page should be covered too, but I didn't want to waste time for that in the test task
- e2e - most of the time, QA engeneers write e2e tests, so I decided not to write any. I can give you link to the project where I worked with cypress
